# Jetbrains Toolbox Projects Registration

This script automates the registration process for JetBrains projects in Jetbrains Toolbox on Windows. It registers the
executable files and icon files of the installed JetBrains projects, allowing them to be opened directly from the
context menu of folders and the background.

## Prerequisites

- This script is intended for the Windows operating system.
- You need to have administrator privileges to run this script.
- Make sure you have disabled the "Keep previous versions of tool to enable instant rollback" feature in Jetbrains
  Toolbox. This helps reduce disk space usage, and the latest version will be properly registered in the system.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run a bash shell as administrator like GitBash.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script.

   ```bash
       bash Open_with_IDE.sh
   ```

5. Follow the instructions provided by the script.
6. Once the registration process is completed, the script will display a completion message.
